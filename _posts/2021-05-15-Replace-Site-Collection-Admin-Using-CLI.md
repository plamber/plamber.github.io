The [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://github.com/pnp/cli-microsoft365) is a cross-platform command-line interface used to manage or automate Microsoft 365 resources. It is a PnP and community-driven initiative that is growing rapidly over time. 

This simple script shows you how to replace a site collection admin of an existing site collection with another user. The script uses the [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://github.com/pnp/cli-microsoft365) to perform all activities.
