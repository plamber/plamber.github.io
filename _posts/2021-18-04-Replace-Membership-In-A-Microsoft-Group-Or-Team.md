The [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://github.com/pnp/cli-microsoft365) is a cross-platform command-line interface used to manage or automate Microsoft 365 resources. It is a PnP and community-driven initiative that is growing rapidly over time. 

This script can help in replacing the membership of an existing user with the permissions of a different one. You could think about a person that changes role or leaves the company. The script is inspired from <a href="https://blog.eardley.org.uk/2021/04/managing-teams-movers-and-leavers/">this blogpost</a>. The script uses the [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://github.com/pnp/cli-microsoft365) to perform all activities.
