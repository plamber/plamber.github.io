The [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://github.com/pnp/cli-microsoft365) is a cross-platform command-line interface used to manage or automate Microsoft 365 resources. It is a PnP and community-driven initiative that is growing rapidly over time. 

Find all the Teams that a user is an Owner of and replace them with someone else useful for when an employee leaves and ownership needs to be updated. The script is inspired from <a href="https://blog.eardley.org.uk/2021/04/managing-teams-movers-and-leavers/">this blogpost</a>. The script uses the [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://github.com/pnp/cli-microsoft365) to perform all activities.
