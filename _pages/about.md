My name is Patrick Lamber and I am a consultant specializing in Microsoft productivity software.

My working career started in 2002 as a database and .NET software developer. After 2007 I had the opportunity to start working with SharePoint as a collaboration tool. It was love at first sight.

Since the launch of Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365), I gradually moved from the classic on-premises world to a cloud-based ecosystem.

Fluent in Italian, English, and German, I have worked with a number of different companies from different sectors including Telecommunications, Retail, Sports, Energy, Healthcare, and Government.
