I"3<p>In the past months I worked on several projects that automated the data collection of local IT assets. During this time, we decided to use the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/tables/">Azure Table Storage</a> service for storing data.</p>

<p>During this time, there was no easy way for me to perform CRUD operations with PowerShell. Meanwhile, you will be able to use the official Microsoft project <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell">Az.Storage</a>. Nevertheless, I wanted to share the module that we are currently successfully using in our projects. I conveniently stored the project for you under <a href="https://github.com/plamber/aztablestorage">this Github repository</a>.</p>

<h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>
<p>Find here a summary how you can use this Module.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get the AZTableModule.psm1 and store it to your desired location</li>
  <li>Get your Azure Storage name and key. You will need it in the script</li>
</ul>
