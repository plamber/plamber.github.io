I"¼<p>Users with a valid SharePoint Online license are eligible to get a dedicated OneDrive for Business site to store their contents. Just like a cloud-based personal hard drive. This OneDrive site will store all contents synchronized with the OneDrive for Business client or stored through other means to the OneDrive site.</p>

<p>At some point in time, the user might leave the company. Typically, such an event triggers the deletion of the user account in Office 365 either through a Microsoft 365 administrator or by the Active Directory synchronization process. After this event, the OneDrive for Business cleanup process kicks in for this user. It generally consists of following high-level steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Account deletion is synchronized with the user profile store in SharePoint Online</li>
  <li>Regularly, a cleanup job is running in the background to verify these user profiles marked for deletion.
    <ul>
      <li>It will move the OneDrive site to the site collection recycle bin after the OneDrive retention period (default 30 days)</li>
      <li>It will also look in the <em>My Site Cleanup</em> settings and verify if the <em>Enable access delegation</em> option is selected. If this is the case, the userâ€™s manager will be assigned as the site collection administrator for the OneDrive site and receive an e-mail notification explaining that the contents should be secured before the OneDrive retention period. The same e-mail will be sent out 14 days before the site is being moved to the site collection recycle bin. In case no manager is appointed, the <em>secondary owner</em> specified in the <em>My Site Cleanup</em> settings will be taken as a responsible person by this process.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A OneDrive site in the recycle bin has 93 days until it is permanently deleted. During this time, all hyperlinks to the site or documents will stop functioning. A SharePoint Online administrator can restore the site within these 93 days.</li>
</ul>
