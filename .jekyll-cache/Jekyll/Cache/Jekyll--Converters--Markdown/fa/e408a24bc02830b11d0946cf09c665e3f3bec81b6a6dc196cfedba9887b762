<p>In this post, we are going to create our first custom connector definition in Power Automation. For sake of simplicity, the custom connector will consume one single <em>action</em> retrieving data from an anonymous ASP.NET Core REST API hosted in Azure.
I am going to guide you on how to create your first connector from scratch.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-need-to-get-started">What do I need to get started?</h2>
<p>This is the prerequisites to get this example up-and-running:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any Visual Studio version with ASP.NET Core</li>
  <li>An Azure Subscription to host your REST API</li>
  <li>A Power Automation subscription with the ability to create your custom connector</li>
  <li>Some basic knowledge about ASP.NET core and REST APIs</li>
  <li>Some basic knowledge on how to create a flow in Power Automation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="1-create-your-api">1) Create your API</h2>
<p>We are not interested in building complex APIs in this exercise. The ASP.NET Core Web Application template will be sufficient.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a new Project in Visual Studio</li>
  <li>Choose the <em>ASP.NET Core Web Application</em> template</li>
  <li>Specify your desired Project Name. I am going to call <em>SimpleRESTApi</em>.</li>
  <li>When asked for the type of web application, choose <em>API</em></li>
</ul>

<p>This will create a standard ASP.NET Core Web Application template with the <em>ValuesController</em>. When starting the debugger it will immediately launch your endpoint [PutYourLocalHostAddressHere]/api/values and return an array of values: [‚Äúvalue1‚Äù,‚Äùvalue2‚Äù].</p>

<h4 id="publish-your-web-application-to-azure">Publish your Web Application to Azure</h4>
<p>We need to push this simple API using the publishing feature in Visual Studio. You can find out how this works <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/deployment/quickstart-deploy-to-azure?view=vs-2019">here</a>.</p>

<p>Once published, note down the URL that you get from Azure. This is important for the custom connector definition later on. You have to note down the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your Azure host: [PutYourAzureHostAddressHere]</li>
  <li>Your REST endpoint for the Values API: [PutYourAzureHostAddressHere]/api/values</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-create-the-custom-connector-in-power-automation">2) Create the custom connector in Power Automation</h2>
<p>Login to your Power Automation interface and choose the <em>Custom Connectors</em> option in the menu.</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/images/2019-10-24-06-33-45.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You will be redirected to the custom connector overview page managed by you. The creation of a new custom connector is performed using the <em>New custom connector</em> option. This example will create it from scratch, therefore, we are going to press <em>New custom connector</em> -&gt; <em>Create from blank</em>.</p>

<p>The system will prompt you for a name. Choose the name wisely because you can only change a custom connector‚Äôs name until it hasn‚Äôt been saved. Once saved, you can‚Äôt change the name. In this exercise, I am calling my connector <em>CustomConnector</em>.</p>

<p>You will be redirected to the next interface. This interface is subdivided into these sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li>General: specify the REST API endpoint, a description, and an icon for the connector</li>
  <li>Security: configure the authentication technique used to authenticate your users against the connector</li>
  <li>Definition: allows you to define actions and triggers for your connector</li>
  <li>Test: allows you to test the endpoints without the need of launching Power Automation and dedicated workflows</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="changes-in-the-general-tab">Changes in the General tab</h4>
<p>You can play around with the <em>General</em> tab. The most important thing to consider for this example is to fill out the correct <em>host</em> value. You noted it before already when publishing your REST API to Azure. Therefore, it will be [PutYourAzureHostAddressHere] without the protocol (<em>HTTPS</em>).</p>

<h4 id="changes-in-the-security-tab">Changes in the Security tab</h4>
<p>We will skip this tab because we are not implementing any authentication for our anonymous connector.</p>

<h4 id="changes-in-the-definition-tab">Changes in the Definition tab</h4>
<p>In this tab, we are going to create a single action. To do this, click <em>New action</em> and fill the basic information about it as shown in the next picture.</p>

<p>On the same screen, you will find the section <em>Request</em>. You have to press the <em>Import from sample</em> option and use the Azure REST API address of your values endpoint. You noted it before and it will be [YourLocalHostAddress]/api/values. Press <em>Import</em> to finalize the definition.</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/images/2019-10-24-06-42-14.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="test-your-flow-from-the-test-tab">Test your flow from the Test tab</h4>
<p>We are almost done. We need to press the <em>Create Connector</em> button before being able to continue and test. After pressing this button, you won‚Äôt be able to change the name of the connector.</p>

<p>You can perform some basic tests. You just need to create a <em>Connection</em>, select the <em>GetValues</em> operation and press the <em>Test operation</em> button. If everything is configured successfully and your REST API available to be consumed, you will get a successful response.</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/images/2019-10-24-06-43-32.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Congratulations, you just created and tested your first custom connector.</p>

<h2 id="3-share-your-connector">3) Share your connector</h2>
<p>You are the owner of the custom connector. You will be able to use it immediately in Power Automation. On the other hand, you can start sharing your connector with individuals or the whole organization.</p>

<p>You can do this from the custom connector overview page. Select <em>Invite another user</em></p>

<p><img src="../../assets/images/2019-10-24-09-01-51.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Select individuals or share them with the whole organization as shown in the next figure.</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/images/2019-10-24-09-02-21.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In case you want to share the connector with the rest of the world, Microsoft allows you to certify your connector. You can do this following <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/submit-certification">this documentation</a>.</p>

<h4 id="4-use-the-connector">4) Use the connector</h4>
<p>After saving and sharing your custom connector, the custom connector is accessible by Power Automation users using the <em>Custom</em> tab when selecting an action.</p>
