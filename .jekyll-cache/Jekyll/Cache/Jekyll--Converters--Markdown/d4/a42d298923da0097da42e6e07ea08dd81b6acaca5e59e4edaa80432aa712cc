I"÷<p>I was looking for a way to change the display language set in a Microsoft Teams Client on a Windows machine.

<p>At the end I found out that you have to perform following operations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Close the Teams client</li>
  <li>Remove two files in your %AppData% folder</li>
  <li>Get the Teams client settings stored in your %AppData% and manipulate the ‚ÄúcurrentWebLanguage‚Äù property</li>
  <li>Overwrite the Teams client settings</li>
</ul>

<p>Afterwards, you simply need to start the Teams Client again.</p>

<p>You can see a sample script below.</p>
