I"J<p>Azure AD allows to configure custom token lifetime policies for the access and refresh tokens. In your tenant you might have the token lifetime policy set to 1 hour for access tokens and 90 days for refresh tokens.</p>

<p>In some cases, you might want to change this policy for a dedicated Azure AD application. I received recently the requirement to reduce the token life time to 10 minutes and the refresh token to 30 minutes. I used the script below to perform this configuration.</p>
