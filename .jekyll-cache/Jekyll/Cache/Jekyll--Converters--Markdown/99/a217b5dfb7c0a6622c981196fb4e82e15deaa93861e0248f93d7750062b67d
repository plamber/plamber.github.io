<p>In this post I would like to go through some of the endpoints in the <a href="https://developer.yammer.com/docs/">Yammer REST API</a> handling user profiles in a network.</p>

<div class="alert success">
    You can generate the baerer token (access token) as described in <a href="/2019-09-01-Access-Yammer-API-Through-Rest">this</a> post. 
</div>

<div class="alert">
    Always consider the <a href="https://developer.yammer.com/docs/rest-api-rate-limits">REST API and Rate Limits</a> when accessing a Yammer network. 
</div>

<h3 id="retrieve-the-users-in-a-network">Retrieve the users in a network</h3>
<p>The snippet presented in this section is retrieving the list of users in a network. By default the list returns batches of 50 users. You can find other parameters under the official <a href="https://developer.yammer.com/docs/usersjson">documentation</a>. The default sorting is alphabetically, but you might want to sort by messages or followers with the sort_by query string. If you have more than 50 users, you might want to use the the page parameter to get different batches.</p>

<div class="alert success">
    Check my blogpost to see how to get all users with a PowerShell commandlet <a href="/Get-All-Yammer-Users-Through-Rest-API-With-PowerShell">here</a>. 
</div>

<h3 id="retrieve-a-user-by-id">Retrieve a user by ID</h3>
<p>The next snippet shows how to retrieve a single user by id instead of accessing it through the whole network.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/plamber/7186fad364fb671b7d6ebe06347ef68c.js?file=retrieveuserbyid.ps1"></script>

<h3 id="retrieve-a-user-by-email">Retrieve a user by email</h3>
<p>Retrieving a user by ID might not always be the option for you. Therefore, Yammer also provides you an endpoint to get the user by e-mail address.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/plamber/7186fad364fb671b7d6ebe06347ef68c.js?file=retrieveuserbymail.ps1"></script>

<h3 id="create-a-new-user">Create a new user</h3>
<p>With the snippet below you are going to create a user profile for a specific user. The service will return a StatusCode 201 if successful. If a user already exist in the network, you will get back a 400 bad request.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/plamber/7186fad364fb671b7d6ebe06347ef68c.js?file=createuser.ps1"></script>

<h3 id="delete-a-user-by-id">Delete a user by ID</h3>
<p>The snippet below shows how to delete a user by ID. By specifying the delete=true parameter in the url, you are going to permanently delete the user. Otherwise, the user is just going to be suspended.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/plamber/7186fad364fb671b7d6ebe06347ef68c.js?file=deleteuserbyid.ps1"></script>
