I"~<p>Office 365 Unified Groups used by several Office 365 services (e.g. Yammer, Exchange, Teams, SharePoint) send a welcome e-mail to newly added users of that specific group. This might be a good thing in many situations from an end-user perspective. On the other hand, you might have the necessity to disable this welcome e-mail for newly added members on that specific group.</p>
