I")<p>I had to change the Teams client display language on my Windows machine using PowerShell.

<p>You can perform the operation by manipulating the desktop-config.json file located on a users profile.
I finally wrote a script that performs following steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Close the Teams client</li>
  <li>Remove two files in your %AppData% folder</li>
  <li>Get the Teams client settings stored in your %AppData% and manipulate the “currentWebLanguage” property</li>
  <li>Overwrite the Teams client settings</li>
</ul>

<p>Start the Teams client and your interface will immediately use the new language.</p>

<p>The script is listed below.</p>
