I"<p>I submitted a request at the <a href="https://microsoftgraph.uservoice.com/forums/920506-microsoft-graph-feature-requests/suggestions/37796059-restrict-permissions-to-app-only-azure-ad-applicat">Microsoft Graph uservoice</a> regarding some improvements of the way app-only permissions are handled in Office 365 on May 31st. In a short timeframe this suggestion became the top2 request for Microsoft Graph. Just 24 days after my request, the product group team told us that they are working on the solution to this problem.</p>
